Below is a **repo-ready, exam-aligned structure** and a **complete `README.md`** you can copy directly into your repository.
The design is optimized for **learning, revision, and auditability**—not just passing the exam, but retaining usable GitHub fundamentals.

---

# 1. Repository Folder Structure

**Aligned to GitHub Foundations exam objectives**


---

## Why this structure works

* **Direct mapping to exam domains**
* Clear separation of **concepts vs hands-on labs**
* Easy to review selectively before the exam
* Suitable for public sharing without looking like “raw notes”

---

# 2. `README.md` (Repo Root)

You can copy-paste the following as-is.

---

```markdown

# 3. Recommended Next Steps

If you want, I can next:

1. Populate **`milestones.md`** with exam-aligned checkpoints
2. Create **starter content** for each domain README
3. Design **labs with step-by-step tasks**
4. Convert this into a **public learning template**

Tell me how deep you want to go, and we will build it incrementally.
