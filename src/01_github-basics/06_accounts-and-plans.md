## Key Mental Model

```
Account = Identity
├── Personal Account (individual)
└── Organization Account (team/company)

Organization = Ownership & Billing Boundary
├── Owns repositories
├── Manages members
└── Handles billing

Plan = Feature Entitlement
├── Free (basic features)
├── Team (team features)
└── Enterprise (advanced features)
```

---

## Ownership and Responsibility

### Personal Account

* **Owner**: Individual person
* **Billing**: Individual responsibility
* **Repositories**: Owned by individual
* **Members**: Just the account owner

### Organization Account

* **Owner**: Organization (not individual)
* **Billing**: Organization responsibility
* **Repositories**: Owned by organization
* **Members**: Multiple people with roles

### Enterprise Account

* **Owner**: Enterprise (parent account)
* **Billing**: Centralized at enterprise level
* **Organizations**: Multiple under enterprise
* **Management**: Centralized administration

## Feature Access vs Usage Entitlement

### Subscription Features

* Included in plan
* Fixed monthly/annual cost
* Examples:
  * Private repositories
  * Team collaboration
  * Advanced security (Enterprise)

### Usage-Based Features

* Metered by consumption
* Additional cost beyond subscription
* Examples:
  * GitHub Actions minutes
  * Storage beyond included amount
  * Advanced security scanning

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Billing is per repository"

**Reality**: Billing is per organization, not per repository. One organization can have unlimited repositories.

### Misconception 2: "Free plan means no private repos"

**Reality**: Free plan includes unlimited private repositories for individuals. Organizations need a paid plan for private repos.

### Misconception 3: "All features are included in subscription"

**Reality**: Some features are metered (usage-based) and incur additional costs.

### Misconception 4: "Account and organization are the same"

**Reality**: 
* Account = identity (who you are)
* Organization = ownership boundary (what you own)

## Choosing the Right Plan

### For Individuals

* **Free**: Sufficient for most personal projects
* **Pro**: If you need more Actions minutes or storage

### For Small Teams

* **Team Plan**: Best for collaboration
* Provides team management features
* Private repositories included

### For Large Organizations

* **Enterprise Plan**: Advanced features
* Security and compliance
* Centralized management
