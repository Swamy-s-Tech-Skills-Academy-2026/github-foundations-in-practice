* **Review Answers**: If time permits, review flagged questions

### Question Strategy

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand what the question is asking
2. **Eliminate Wrong Answers**: Cross out obviously incorrect options
3. **Look for Keywords**: Pay attention to words like "always", "never", "best", "most appropriate"
4. **Consider Context**: Scenario-based questions require understanding the full context
5. **Trust Your First Instinct**: Usually your first answer is correct

### Common Question Patterns

**Scenario-Based Questions**:
- "You need to..." → What is the best approach?
- "A team member wants to..." → What should they do?
- "You want to ensure..." → What configuration is needed?

**Definition Questions**:
- "What is the difference between X and Y?"
- "Which statement is true about X?"

**Workflow Questions**:
- "What is the correct order of steps?"
- "What happens when you do X?"
